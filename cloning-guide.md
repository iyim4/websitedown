# Cloning Guide
for this app

## Required software
[Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and remember to update these!
```
git config --global user.name "name"
git config --global user.email "email@example.com"
```

[Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). If there's a "running scripts is disabled" error on windows, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`


## Cloning the repo
run `git clone https://github.com/iyim4/websitedown.git`, which will create a folder/directory named `websitedown`. This clones with HTTPS, meaning you must login with your GitHub account on a browser. Alternatively, you can

run `npm install`, which installs all the node dependencies
